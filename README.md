# Files for grading:

- "main.ipynb"
    Contains the main program, results, and the discussion notes.

- "ml_library.py"
    Contains the programs from previous labs to train, validate, and plot. File is loaded as `ML` and methods are called within "Main.ipynb".

- "model/resnet50_model_152p.pth"
    The ResNet152 model that achieved 87% accuracy against the test dataset. The model exceeded the 200MB upload limit for GitHub. Please reach out to request a copy.

# Instructions for Grad-Cam:

To test the functionality of grad-cam, execute cells 1 - 4 prior to executing everything below the **Fifth Step** section.
